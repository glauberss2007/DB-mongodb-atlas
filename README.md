1. What is MongoDB?
  - Collection - an organized store of documents in MongoDB usually with common fields between documents. There can be many collections per database and many documents per collection.
  - Document - a way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs.
  - Field - a unique identifier for a datapoint.
  - Value - data related to a given identifier.
  - Replica Set - a few connected machines that store the same data to ensure that if something happens to one of the machines the data will remain intact. Comes from the word replicate - to copy something.

Instance - a single machine locally or in the cloud, running a certain software, in our case it is the MongoDB database.

Cluster - group of servers that store your data.

3. Importing, Exporting, and Querying Data BSON, JSON, importing and exporting data, and Basic Queries
4. Creating and Manipulating Documents Insert, Update, and Delete operations
5. Advanced CRUD Operations Query operators: element operators, logical operators, array operators, and the regex operator
6. Indexing and Aggregation Pipeline aggregation, indexes, data modeling
7. Next Steps Atlas Data Explorer, Performance Advisor, Charts, Realm, Compass
